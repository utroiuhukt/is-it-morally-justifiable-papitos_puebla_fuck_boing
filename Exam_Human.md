What is the Darknet?
R= it's the subset of the internet that is not indexed 

Is it morally respectable to use individuals (even if they are criminals)?
R= Well quoted the phrase "If you can't beat the enemy, join them." These individuals possess very valuable knowledge about topics that perhaps people who haven't been directly involved in certain businesses or illegal activities may not master as well. I don't believe their actions are justified, but as Caro Quintero said: "Lo hecho hecho está y asi se escribe la historia" We must make use of the resources.

Does the fact that he has been working with the justice redeem the crimes he did?
R= Not at all, a person who is a criminal will always carry that stain, but I believe in rehabilitation and second chances.

Pick one of the measures that he took to protect himself, what principle did he violate?
R= Using other people's addresses to sell their merchandise. That is identity theft.

If you had the opportunity to ask Sam Bent about his experience, what would you ask him?
R= I would tell them to give me recommendations on how to protect myself. I know they're not a hacker or anything, but they have incredible creativity.

1. **Who is Sam Bent?**  
Sam Bent is a drug trafficker on the Darknet who was arrested in 2019 for selling illegal drugs online. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but the final sentence was 5 years in jail, followed by 3 years of supervised release, and a $14,000 fine.  

2. **What is the Darknet?**  
The Darknet is a part of the internet that is not indexed by conventional search engines and requires specialized software, like Tor, to access. It is used for both legitimate and illegal activities, such as the sale of drugs, weapons, and other illicit products.  

3. **Is it morally respectable to use individuals (even if they are criminals)?**  
In the end, we are all used as means to an end, in some cases more than others. Therefore, I believe it is not morally respectable, but it is so common that no one thinks about the moral aspect of using people.  

4. **Does the fact that he worked with the justice system redeem the crimes he committed?**  
Working with the justice system can be a step toward responsibility and accountability, but it does not necessarily redeem the crimes committed. Redemption depends on the severity of the actions, genuine remorse, and subsequent efforts to repair the harm caused.  

5. **Choose one of the measures he took to protect himself. Which principle did he violate?**  
Sam Bent used encryption and anonymity techniques to protect his identity on the Darknet. By doing so, he violated the principle of justice, as his actions facilitated illegal activities that harmed others and bypassed the legal system.  

6. **If you had the opportunity to ask Sam Bent about his experience, what would you ask him?**  
I would ask him: "Do you think what you did in the past affected society, or do you believe that each person is responsible for their own actions and you don't feel guilty or responsible for people's addictions?"  

7. **Relevant principles in this case:**  
In this case, the principles of privacy, justice, and responsibility are fundamental. Sam Bent used privacy to protect his illegal activities, which clashes with the principle of justice. Although he took responsibility by collaborating with the justice system, his initial actions violated the law since selling drugs is illegal. This creates a conflict between individual privacy and the law.

Inculpar a alguien, de todos modos buenas personas no son.

## **Diego Muñoz Elizalde**
What is the Darknet? Es una web que esta oculta y que las personas entran y que saben la ubicación ni el nombre de nadie. 

Is it morally respectable to use individuals (even if they are criminals)?
No, ya que apesar de que ellos se merecen una sentencia, no se merecen la de él.

Does the fact that he has been working with the justice redeem the crimes he did? No del todo, tal vez  la ley por alguna razón se lo perdone pero otras personas no.

Pick one of the measures that he took to protect himself, what principle did he violate? Dar la dirección de otra persona mala.
Inculpar a alguien y apesar de que ellos también se merecen consecuencias, no signifique se merecen la sentencia de él.

If you had the opportunity to ask Sam Bent about his experience, what would you ask him? Qué consecuencia tiene eso en hoy en día hablando de manera emocional.

## Conclusion:
Las acciones de Sam Bent no son jutificables por ningun lado. Que ponga la direccion de criminales no quiere decir que este bien vender drogas.
En un equipo de trabajo como en el FBI (en nuestra opinion) es importante (mas no fundamental) tener gente experta en el area que desean investigar y/o "atacar".
